### Hey there! 
I'm Thomas and I love to learn new things.
This is my academic portfolio, so feel free to explore my research interests.

Currently, I pursue a PhD in physics at the [Max Planck Institute for Multidisciplinary Sciences](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/de) in GÃ¶ttingen and [Heidelberg University](https://www.uni-heidelberg.de/en).
Joining the group of [Stefan Hell](https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/de/hell), I develop new methods for sub-diffraction scale microscopy.

I graduated in Physics and Philosophy (Hannover) and was fortunate to spend time at CERN, Stanford University and Universitetet i Agder during my studies.

My general research interest is in the field of novel imaging methods, (quantum) metrology and applied quantum information:
*How do quantum mechanical properties affect the extraction, communication and processing of information?* 

Besides my work in physics, I am interested in philosophy. 
Having studied philosophy of science allows me to broaden my view beyond my subject and to discover the links between science and the socio-political context.
